# UI Improvements - Customer-Facing POS Interface

## Overview
Enhanced the POS application with customer-friendly messages, beautiful UI, and clear status indicators suitable for customer-facing displays.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Status Messages
All technical jargon has been replaced with customer-friendly messages:

#### Floating Action Button States:
- **Permission Needed** - Orange color with USB icon
- **Searching...** - Blue color with search icon
- **Found [N]** - Purple color with printer icon
- **Ready to Print** - Green color with checkmark icon

#### User-Facing Messages:
- ✓ Instead of "Selected printer: TM-T88VI" → "✓ Printer connected via WiFi/USB"
- ✓ Instead of "Test print completed!" → "✓ Receipt printed successfully!"
- ✓ Instead of "USB permission denied" → "Printer access not granted. Please allow access to continue."
- ✓ Instead of "Test print failed" → "Print failed. Please check printer connection."

### 2. Black Status Overlay Screen
When tapping the printer icon, a beautiful black overlay appears showing:

- **Large colorful icons** for each state
- **Clear headings** (e.g., "Printer Access Required", "Searching for Printer", "Printer Ready")
- **Descriptive messages** explaining what's happening
- **Progress indicators** when searching or connecting
- **Action buttons** for user interaction (e.g., "Grant Permission")
- **Connection details** showing WiFi or USB connection type
